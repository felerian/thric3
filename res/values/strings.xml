    <string name="manual_properties">Color: red, green or blue\nShape: clubs, hearts or diamonds\nNumber: one, two or three\nFilling: empty, half or full</string>
    <string name="manual_valid_set">A valid SET consists of three cards which are either all equal or all different in each of these four properties. This is an example of a valid SET.</string>
    <string name="manual_invalid_set">This is not a valid SET, because two of these cards are green and one is blue. This tutorial will help you learn how to recognize valid SETs.</string>
